This is a social media app called Frens. The frontend is react native in src/cliq.client. The backend is asp.net core in src/Cliq.Server. 

My current version of this website is an app that allows you to only post to specific friends and "circles" -- essentially groups.

There are two types of circles - 
"Private" -- only the owner can add users, only the user can post, only the user can see who are members.
"Shared" -- only the owner can add users (still), but anyone added can post to it, and anyone in it can see who are members.
Either of these circle types can also be marked as "subscribable" allowing users to opt-in to the circle, so you dont have to choose them yourself. Ensures users are interested in a topic before you bombard them with discussion on it.

Currently circles are denoted like this in the UI to make this simpler for users to understand:
[switch] - "Any member can post" -- controls if it is private/public
[switch] - "Any friend can join, advertised on feed" -- controls if it is subscribable.

Posts can also be events. Posts have reddit-style comment sections and images.

The typescript client used by the frontend to make api calls is in src/cliq.client/services/generated/generatedClient.ts It is autogenerated via nswag every time the server is built. To call an api from the frontend, use the react hook useApi.ts in src/cliq.client/hooks/useApi.ts which uses the autogenerated client under the hood wrapped with auth token handling.
