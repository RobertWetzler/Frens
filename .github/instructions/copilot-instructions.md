This is a social media app called Frens. The frontend is react native in src/cliq.client. The backend is asp.net core in src/Cliq.Server. 

The typescript client used by the frontend to make api calls is in src/cliq.client/services/generated/generatedClient.ts It is autogenerated via nswag every time the server is built. To call an api from the frontend, use the react hook useApi.ts in src/cliq.client/hooks/useApi.ts which uses the autogenerated client under the hood wrapped with auth token handling.
